4034197,utility,1977-07-05,Digital filter circuit," In U.S. Pat. No. 3,906,199, issued to R. B. Kieburtz and K. V. Mina on Sept. 16, 1975, limit cycle noise is reduced in a second order recursive digital filter by a circuit which randomly inhibits the rounding signal in one of the digital multipliers disposed in the filter. It has been found, however, that in certain instances, this approach results in even longer transients. In accordance with the present invention, random inhibiting is constrained to instances in which limit cycle noise is reduced, by monitoring, with suitable logic circuitry, the signals present in the various feedback loops of the filter. Generally, it has been found that the inhibiting circuit should be allowed to operate only if D.sub.1 and D.sub.2 satisfy predetermined magnitude and polarity relationships, where D.sub.1 .ident. a version of the filter output signal Y(n) that is removed in time by one sample interval, and D.sub.2 .ident. a version of the filter output signal Y(n) that is removed in time by two sample intervals. In accordance with another aspect of the invention, DC and half sampling rate limit cycles are eliminated by monitoring three consecutive values of D.sub.1 or, alternatively, the present values of Y(n), D.sub.1 and D.sub.2. If the same magnitudes are detected, the magnitude of the next D.sub.1 is reduced by one. ",A,29.0,0.0,pftaps19770705_wk27.zip

4063220,utility,1977-12-13,Multipoint data communication system with collision detection," Apparatus for enabling communications between two or more data processing stations comprising a communication cable arranged in branched segments including taps distributed thereover. Tied to each tap is a transceiver which on the other side connects to an associated interface stage. Each transceiver includes, in addition to the usual transmitter and receiver sections, a gate which compares the data from the interface stage with the data on the cable and indicates whether such are equal. Should such be unequal, an interference between the transceiver and the cable is indicated, disabling the associated transmitter section. Each interface stage tied to such transceiver also includes an input and an output buffer on the other end thereof interfacing with a using device, such input and output buffers storing both the incoming and outgoing data. The output buffer is connected to a clock-driven shift register which converts the buffered data to a serial stream, feeds such data to a phase encoder, which then connects to the transmitter or driver section of the transceiver. The input buffer is loaded by an input shift register which derives its clock from a phase decoder, the shift register and the phase decoder both connecting to the receiver section. When the station is to start transmitting, the phase decoder detects the presence of other transmissions on the cable and detains the output shift register until no other transmissions are sensed. Once a transmission has begun, if interference is detected and the transmitter section is disabled, a random number generator is used to select an interval of time at the completion of which the next attempted transmission will take place. Concurrently, a counter counts the number of interferences, or collisions, which recur in the attempted transmissions of one data packet and weights the mean of the random number generator accordingly. The input shift register is also connected to an address decoder which enables data transfer to the input buffer only during those times when the data is preceded by an appropriate address.

4115914,utility,1978-09-26,Electrically erasable non-volatile semiconductor memory," A non-volatile semiconductor storage device comprising a dual gate field effect transistor in which an electrically floating gate acts as a charge storage medium. An insulating layer of an appropriate dielectric material separates the floating gate from the active portion of the transistor. A predetermined section of this insulating layer is relatively thin to permit this section of the floating gate to be relatively close to a corresponding predetermined section of the transistor, thus facilitating the transfer of charges between the transistor substrate and the gate. When charges reach the floating gate either through tunneling or avalanche injection, they are entrapped and stored there, thus providing memory in the structure. That is, the electric field induced by these charges is maintained in the transistor even after the field inducing force is removed. Erasing is achieved by removing the charges from the floating gate by reverse tunneling through the relatively thinner insulator region. ",A,12.0,0.0,pftaps19780926_wk39.zip

Operations are performed on data from vector register to functional unit and back to vector register with minimal delay, rather than memory to functional unit and return to memory with its attendant much greater start-up delays. Data may be bulk transferred between memory and some vector registers while other vector registers are involved in vector processing with one or more functional units. In vector processing elements of one or more vector registers are successively transmitted as operands to a functional unit at a rate of one per clock period, and results are transmitted from a functional unit to a receiving vector register at the same rate. In a chaining mode of operation, the elements in a result vector register become available for immediate and simultaneous transmission as operands to another functional unit. In this mode, more than one result can be obtained per clock period. ",A,12.0,0.0,pftaps19781205_wk49.zip

The camera includes a charge coupled device comprised of an array of photosensitive elements which form a charge pattern corresponding to an optical image projected onto the elements during an exposure interval. A charge transfer circuit converts the charge pattern into a high frequency pulsed electrical signal immediately following the exposure interval to remove the charge from the device in a short period of time to maintain unwanted ""dark current"" at a low level. Each pulse represents the image-forming light projected onto a particular photosensitive element. A high speed analog-to-digital converter converts these pulses to multi-bit digital words in real time. A digital buffer memory temporarily stores these words, then retransmits them at a rate that is compatible for recording on the audio-grade tape.

The iris of the eye is used an optical fingerprint, having a highly detailed pattern that is unique for each individual and stable over many years. Image analysis algorithms find the iris in a live video image of a person's face, and encode its texture into a compact signature, or ""iris code."" Iris texture is extracted from the image at multiple scales of analysis by a self-similar set of quadrature (2-D Gabor) bandpass filters defined in a dimensionless polar coordinate system. The sign of the projection of many different parts of the iris onto these multi-scale quadrature filters, determines each bit in an abstract (256-byte) iris code. The degrees-of-freedom in this code are based on the principle forms of variation in a population of irises studied. Because of the universal mathematical format and constant length of the iris codes, comparisons between them are readily implemented by the Exclusive-OR (XOR) logical operation. Pattern recognition is achieved by combining special signal processing methods with statistical decision theory, leading to a statistical test of independence based on a similarity metric (the Hamming distance) that is computed from the XOR of any two iris codes. This measure positively establishes, confirms, or disconfirms, the identity of any individual.

Given a source signal whose high information rate exceeds the practical information carrying capacity of the available broadcast channel bandwidth, the invention increases the effective capacity of the broadcast system to effectively communicate such a source signal. The high-rate signal is split into several low-rate signals such that each can be accommodated within the allocated bandwidth. These low-rate signals are transmitted from spatially separated transmitters, all radiating into the service area in the same frequency channel. Each receiver uses a plurality of antennas to receive these multiple cochannel signals that arrive from different directions-of-arrival. The receiver exploits the directions-of-arrival differences of these cochannel signals to separate them into the individually transmitted signals. The separated signals are then demodulated to extract the information signals which are then combined to obtain the original high-rate source signal. Thus, the broadcast information capacity can be increased several-fold. ",A,4.0,0.0,pftaps19940906_wk36.zip
